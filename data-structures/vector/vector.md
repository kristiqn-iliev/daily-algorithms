This self implemented vector data structure is designed to make the implementation of algorithms easier, because they mostly use vectors of numbers. This custom data structures contains methods that allow:

- seemless assignments with hardcoded lists;
- instantiating direct copies of objects of the same class;
- printing the data of the vector to the console;
- instantiating an object with a given hardcoded list;
