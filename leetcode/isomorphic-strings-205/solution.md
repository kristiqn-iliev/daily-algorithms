Solved the problem with the approach of checking if a key exists and if yes find its occurence and see if current pair matches the found one in the map.

If the key does not exist check if there has been already a corresponding value to the one to be added with a previously seen key.

Rather than the naive approach of making 2 maps to make the mirror checks.

Beats 100%.
