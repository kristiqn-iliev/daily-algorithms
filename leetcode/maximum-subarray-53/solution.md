Implemented a subarray recursion logic which takes the array and checks the subbaray with the left element excluded and then the subarray with the right element excluded and it breaks with long arrays because it makes too many redundant checks.

I implemented this knowing that I make too many steps and also the that question is taken from the dp section. I had thought of some solutions in this direction and thought of some but they seemed not too optimal so i made the easiest least optimal solution in order to at least pass some test.

With infinite time and memory I have a working solution, but the task is not solved yet.
